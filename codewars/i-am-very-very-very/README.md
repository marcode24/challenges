# I Am Very Very Very

## Description

You are very very happy and very very very excited to solve this Kata.
Show it to us by creating a function iam such as:

```js
iam('happy') // returns the string "I am happy"
iam('excited') // returns the string "I am excited"
iam()('scared') // returns the string "I am very scared"
iam()()('interested') // returns the string "I am very very interested"
```
and so on...

As you understood, the function iam accept 1 optional parameter.
If provided, the function returns a string.
If NOT provided, it must returns a function allowing to continue the sentence.

I am very very very curious to see you approach the problem.

Enjoy!
